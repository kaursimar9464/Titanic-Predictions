# Titanic Survival Prediction 

This project analyzes the Titanic dataset from Kaggle using multiple classification models:

✅ Logistic Regression  
✅ Random Forest  
✅ XGBoost  
✅ SVM  
✅ KNN  
✅ Naive Bayes  

The goal is to predict survival outcomes based on passenger features like class, fare, sex, and age.

## Dataset
- [Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yasserh/titanic-dataset/data)

## Key Results
- Best model: **Logistic Regression** with ~80% accuracy
- Most important feature: **Sex (female)** had the highest survival rate

## How to Run
1. Install dependencies:
    pip install -r requirements.txt
2. Open the notebook:
