# Titanic Survival Prediction 

This project analyzes the Titanic dataset using various classification algorithms to predict passenger survival.

##  Models Used
- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest
- XGBoost
- Naive Bayes
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)

## Features Engineered
- Sex encoded as `Sex2`
- Embarked port encoded as `Embarked2`
- Dropped high-null or non-informative columns like `Name`, `Cabin`, `Ticket`
- Imputed missing values for `Age`, `Embarked`, and `Fare`

## Visualizations
- **Correlation heatmap** of features with survival
- **Bar plots** showing survival rates by sex and class
- **Box plots** for age distribution across survival status
- **Feature importance bar plots** for:
  - Logistic Regression (via coefficients)
  - Random Forest and XGBoost (via built-in importance)
- **Pair plots** and **violin plots** to explore feature distributions

## Evaluation Metrics
- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1 Score
- Confusion Matrix
- ROC Curve
- Feature Importance plots
